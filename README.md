Hi, This repo contains the zipped source code for a console app that can be used to recursively download a webpage.
This application has an auto timeout of 15 minutes to avoid any unwanted load on the running machine.
you can download the default url by pressing spacebar or type the url you want to download.
default storage drive is C but this can be changed in the config file.
